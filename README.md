# Groovy NullPointerException Despite Null-Safe Operator

This example demonstrates a scenario where Groovy's null-safe operator (?.), although intended to prevent `NullPointerExceptions`, doesn't always succeed.  The issue arises when a method doesn't properly handle null input and returns null itself, which subsequently causes an exception in a null-safe operation.

The `bug.groovy` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.groovy` provides a solution.

## How to reproduce:
1. Save the code in `bug.groovy`.
2. Run the script using a Groovy interpreter (e.g., `groovy bug.groovy`).

You'll observe a `NullPointerException` during execution.

## Solution:
The solution involves either explicitly handling the null within the initial method (`myMethod`) or using a more robust null handling technique (such as the Elvis operator) in the second method to prevent the downstream exception.
